Recall: 

<...> = value of argument
[...] = optional argument


==========
diff <file1> <file2>

- Bash command to show the changes between two files 

diff -u <file1> <file2> > <file.diff>

- Write STOUT of cmd showing all difference between the two files
  into file.diff


==========
patch <file> < <file.diff>

- Bash command to apply changes from a .diff file made from the diff cmd
  onto the file in question




====================
BASIC GIT OPERATIONS
====================

==========
git init [OPTIONS] [directory]

- Git command that creates an empty repository in the current file directory
- basically a .git directory with subdirectories containing the necessary config files
- If .git exists, reinitialise git to use that repository

- If [directory] is empty, use current directory

==========
git clone [OPTIONS] [--] <repository> [<target-directory>]

- Git command to clone from remote <repository> into a directory specified by [<target-directory>]
- If [target-directory] is not specified, Git creates new directory from the <repository> name into the
  current directory
  - Example:
    pwd: /x/Programming/GitHub/Reposistories/ and 
    cmd: git clone https://github.com/Sti11itS/hello-world.git results in
    directory: /x/Programming/GitHub/Repositories/hello-world
    and contents


==========
git config

*** See online documentation or local cmd help

git config --list --show-origin
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2114111/where-does-git-config-global-get-write-to
- Global file located at C:/Users/Julian/.gitconfig

git config --global -l
- List all config key.value pairs in the git global config file

git config --global <key> <"value"> OR 
git config --global --add <key> <value>
- Adds a key.value pair in the global config file


==========
git add <file>

_ Git updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare 
  the content staged for the next commit.
- The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that 
  is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, 
  and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files 
  to the index.
- This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of 
  the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included 
  in the next commit, then you must run git add again to add the new content to the index.

git add -p

- Shows changes being added and asks whether you want to stage it or not


==========
git status

- Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, 
  paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the 
  working tree that are not tracked by Git (and are not ignored by gitignore[5]). 
- The first are what you would commit by running git commit; the second and third are what 
  you could commit by running git add before running git commit.


==========
git diff [<options>] [--] [<path> ...]

- Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, 
  changes between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or 
  changes between two files on disk.

git diff -u/-p/--patch

- Generates detailed differences between the modified and original files

==========
git commit [<options>]

*******************************************************
- Must have a commit message for the commit to suceed
*******************************************************
- Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes.
- See online documentation

git commit -m <message>

- use the given <message> as the commit message

==========
git log [<options>]

- Shows commit logs for current git init
- See online documentation

git log -p/-u/--patch

- -p = patch
- Similar to diff -u

git lot --stat

- Shows a diffstat

==========
git show [<options>] [<objects> ...]

- Show details for one or more [<objects>]. Can be blobs, trees, tags and commits

git show [<COMMIT ID from git log>]

- Shows log entry for [<COMMIT ID>] generated by git log


==========
git rm <file>

- Removes <file> from the directory


==========
git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>

- Similiar to Bash, renames <old_file_name> to <new_file_name>



=================================
OPERATIONS TO MAKE CHANGES IN GIT 
=================================

==========
git checkout <file>

- To undo unstaged changes
- To discard changes to the <file> in the working directory BEFORE being 
  commited or staged, ie. before git add and git commit
- Restores the <file> to the latest storage snapshot.


==========
git reset <commit_id> <file>

Usually git reset HEAD <file>

- To undo staged changes, esp after "git add *"
- To discard changes recorded in the staging area to the current snapshot
- Just as git add adds changes to the staging area, git reset removes changes
  from the staging area


==========
git commit --amend

- Amends the most recent commit with additional actions

- eg: git add 1 file instead of 2. git add the missing file and do git commit --amend
      This allows an opportunity to update the commit message

******************************************************************
- Avoid amending commits that have already been made public
- This is due to commit_id being made from SHA1 of the commit data
******************************************************************


==========
git revert <commit_id>

Usually git revert HEAD

- REVERT performs the inverse actions of the previous commit which then submits it
  as the next COMMIT
- This way, the REVERT operation is tracked as a COMMIT rather than a full undo 
  operation as though the previous commit did not happen
- keyword: Rollback

- use git log -p -# to show the # of previous commits and their commit-ids
- use git show <commit_id> to display detail for that commit
